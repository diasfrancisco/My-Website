# Website

### This is a website I am working on to be able to showcase my passion in Art, Computing and Science
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Art section will include multiple panels showcasing digital art I have worked on and any tips and tricks I find during my journey through digital art.

The Computing section will contain any computiing based projects I am working on - I will defintely add the process I followed to be able to create my website from scratch.
Also, I will add any ML projects and any resources I find in regards to understanding the methodology and coding practices related to ML.

Finally, as a Biotechnology graduate I will be looking at various advances in science and how these methods have come about.
I am particularly interested about nanotechnology and will be exploring areas of overlap between computing and nanotechnology.

***WORK IN PROGRESS***
